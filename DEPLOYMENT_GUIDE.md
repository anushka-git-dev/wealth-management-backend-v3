# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Guide
## Wealth Management Backend Application

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup Steps

### 1. **Project Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Updated `package.json` with Node.js 20 engine specification
- ‚úÖ Created `.ebignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment
- ‚úÖ Created `.ebextensions` configuration directory with:
  - `01_nodejs.config` - Node.js and proxy configuration
  - `02_environment.config` - Environment and health check settings

### 2. **Elastic Beanstalk Initialization**
- ‚úÖ Initialized EB application: `wealth-management-backend`
- ‚úÖ Region: `us-east-1`
- ‚úÖ Platform: Node.js 20 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023
- ‚úÖ Environment Name: `wealth-management-env`
- ‚úÖ Instance Type: t2.micro

### 3. **Environment Creation**
- ‚è≥ Environment is currently being created (takes 5-10 minutes)
- Application version uploaded to S3
- Environment ID: Will be available once creation completes

## üìã Next Steps

### Step 1: Monitor Environment Creation

Check the status of your environment:
```powershell
# Add EB CLI to PATH (if needed in new terminal)
$env:Path += ";C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python310\Scripts"

# Check environment status
eb status
```

Expected output when ready:
```
Environment details for: wealth-management-env
  Application name: wealth-management-backend
  Region: us-east-1
  Platform: Node.js 20 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023
  Status: Ready
  Health: Green
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

After the environment is created, set the required environment variables:

```powershell
# Set environment variables one by one
eb setenv MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
eb setenv JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
eb setenv AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key"
eb setenv AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_key"
eb setenv AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
eb setenv NODE_ENV="production"
```

**OR** set all at once:
```powershell
eb setenv MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string" JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key" AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key" AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_key" AWS_REGION="us-east-1" NODE_ENV="production"
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application Updates (Future)

When you need to deploy code changes:
```powershell
eb deploy
```

### Step 4: Open Application in Browser

Once the environment is ready:
```powershell
eb open
```

This will open your application URL in the default browser.

## üîí Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` file to version control
- ‚úÖ Use EB environment variables for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Rotate AWS credentials regularly
- ‚úÖ Use strong JWT secrets

### MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. **Whitelist EB IP Addresses:**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí Network Access
   - Add the IP address of your EB environment
   - Or use `0.0.0.0/0` for development (not recommended for production)

2. **Connection String:**
   - Use the MongoDB Atlas connection string in `MONGODB_URI`
   - Format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database-name`

### AWS Bedrock Access
- Ensure IAM role has permissions for Bedrock API
- Verify Claude 3 Sonnet model is enabled in your AWS account

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

### View Application Logs
```powershell
# View last 100 lines
eb logs

# Follow logs in real-time
eb logs --stream

# View specific log file
eb logs --log-file /var/log/nodejs/nodejs.log
```

### CloudWatch Integration
- Application logs are automatically sent to CloudWatch Logs
- Access via AWS Console ‚Üí CloudWatch ‚Üí Log Groups
- Log group: `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/wealth-management-env/`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Environment Creation Failed
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check events for error details
eb events

# Check logs
eb logs
```

### Issue: Application Not Starting
**Possible causes:**
1. Missing environment variables
2. MongoDB connection failure
3. Port configuration mismatch

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check environment variables
eb printenv

# Check logs for startup errors
eb logs

# Verify health status
eb health --refresh
```

### Issue: MongoDB Connection Error
**Solution:**
1. Verify MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes EB instance IP
2. Check `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is set correctly
3. Test connection string locally first

### Issue: Health Check Failures
**Possible causes:**
- Application not responding on port 8080
- Health check path returning error

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check health check configuration
eb config

# View detailed health information
eb health --view

# Check application logs
eb logs
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Current Configuration:
- **Instance Type:** t2.micro (Free tier eligible)
- **Load Balancer:** Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Data Transfer:** Pay as you go

### Free Tier Eligible:
- 750 hours/month of t2.micro instance
- 25 GB of storage
- 1 GB data transfer per month

### To Reduce Costs:
1. Use single instance (no load balancer) for development
2. Terminate environment when not in use
3. Monitor usage in AWS Cost Explorer

---

## üîÑ Scaling Configuration

### Auto Scaling (Future)
To enable auto-scaling, edit `.ebextensions/02_environment.config`:

```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:autoscaling:asg:
    MinSize: 1
    MaxSize: 4
  aws:autoscaling:trigger:
    MeasureName: CPUUtilization
    Statistic: Average
    Unit: Percent
    UpperThreshold: 80
    LowerThreshold: 20
```

Then deploy:
```powershell
eb deploy
```
