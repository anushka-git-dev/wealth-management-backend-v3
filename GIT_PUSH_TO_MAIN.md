# How to Push Updated Code to Main Branch

## Current Situation
- You're on branch: `feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2`
- You want to: Push changes to `main` branch

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW (Proper Git Flow)

### Step 1: Commit All Changes on Feature Branch

```bash
# Check what files have changed
git status

# Add all changed files
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add AI recommendation system with AWS Bedrock and Claude 3 Haiku"
```

---

### Step 2: Switch to Main Branch

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main
```

---

### Step 3: Pull Latest Changes from Remote (Important!)

```bash
# Get latest changes from remote main branch
git pull origin main
```

---

### Step 4: Merge Feature Branch into Main

```bash
# Merge your feature branch into main
git merge feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2
```

**If there are conflicts:**
- Git will tell you which files have conflicts
- Open those files and resolve conflicts
- Then run:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Merge feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2 into main"
  ```

---

### Step 5: Push to Remote Main Branch

```bash
# Push main branch to remote repository
git push origin main
```

---

## üöÄ QUICK COMMANDS (Copy & Paste)

If you're confident everything is ready:

```bash
# 1. Commit current changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add AI recommendation system with AWS Bedrock and Claude 3 Haiku"

# 2. Switch to main
git checkout main

# 3. Pull latest
git pull origin main

# 4. Merge feature branch
git merge feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2

# 5. Push to remote
git push origin main
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ALTERNATIVE: Push Feature Branch First (Safer)

If you want to be safer and create a Pull Request:

```bash
# 1. Commit changes on feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add AI recommendation system with AWS Bedrock and Claude 3 Haiku"

# 2. Push feature branch to remote
git push origin feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2

# 3. Create Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab
# Then merge via web interface after review
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Allows code review
- ‚úÖ Keeps history clean
- ‚úÖ Can discuss changes before merging
- ‚úÖ Safer for team projects

```

---

## üîç CHECK BEFORE PUSHING

Run these checks first:

```bash
# 1. Check current branch
git branch

# 2. Check status
git status

# 3. See what will be committed
git diff

# 4. Check commit history
git log --oneline -5
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY CHECKS

### Before Merging to Main:

1. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Test all endpoints in Postman
   ```

2. **Check for sensitive data:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure .env is not committed
   git ls-files | grep .env
   # Should return nothing or only .env.example
   ```

3. **Review changes:**
   ```bash
   git diff main feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2
   ```

---

## ‚ùå COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Pushing .env file
```bash
# Check .gitignore has .env
cat .gitignore | grep .env

# If .env was committed by accident, remove it:
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env file from tracking"
```

### Mistake 2: Force pushing to main (DON'T!)
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER do this on main branch:
git push --force origin main  # DANGEROUS!

# ‚úÖ Only regular push:
git push origin main
```

### Mistake 3: Not pulling before push
```bash
# Always pull first to avoid conflicts:
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

---

## üîÑ IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Undo last commit (before push):
```bash
# Keep changes but undo commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes and undo commit (CAREFUL!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Undo merge (if you haven't pushed):
```bash
git merge --abort
```

### Already pushed and want to revert:
```bash
# Create a new commit that undoes the changes
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

## üìä CHECK PUSH STATUS

After pushing:

```bash
# Check if push was successful
git status

# Verify remote has your commits
git log origin/main --oneline -5

# Compare local and remote
git diff main origin/main
```

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR YOUR PROJECT

Since you have a working AI recommendation system:

```bash
# 1. Make sure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete AI recommendation system implementation"

# 2. Push feature branch (for backup)
git push origin feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2

# 3. Switch to main
git checkout main

# 4. Pull latest
git pull origin main

# 5. Merge feature
git merge feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2

# 6. Push to main
git push origin main

# 7. (Optional) Delete feature branch locally
git branch -d feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2

# 8. (Optional) Delete feature branch remotely
git push origin --delete feature/recommendation-llm-system-v2
```
