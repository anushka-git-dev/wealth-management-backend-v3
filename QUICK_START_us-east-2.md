## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Environment Health is Yellow/Red:
1. Check logs in AWS Console
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check MongoDB connection string
4. Ensure MongoDB Atlas IP is whitelisted

### Can't access application:
1. Verify environment status is "Ready"
2. Check the URL is correct
3. Ensure security groups allow HTTP (port 80)

### MongoDB connection errors:
1. Verify MONGODB_URI in environment variables
2. Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
3. Verify IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas
4. Test connection string locally first
