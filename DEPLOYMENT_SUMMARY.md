---

## üìã NEXT STEPS - ACTION REQUIRED

### ‚è∞ Step 1: Wait for Environment Creation (5-10 minutes)

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "E:\My-Education\Full-Stack-Dev\AI\AI Assist Vibe Coding-2025\Day-2\wealth-management-backend-v3"

# Add EB CLI to PATH
$env:Path += ";C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python310\Scripts"

# Check environment status (run every 1-2 minutes)
eb status
```

**Wait until you see:**
- Status: `Ready` ‚úÖ
- Health: `Green` ‚úÖ

---

### üîß Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Once the environment is **Ready**, set your environment variables:

```powershell
# Set MongoDB connection string
eb setenv MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.zxlwopw.mongodb.net/wealth-management-app-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"

# Set JWT secret
eb setenv JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-2025"

# Set AWS credentials (if using AWS Bedrock)
eb setenv AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key"
eb setenv AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_key"
eb setenv AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Set Node environment
eb setenv NODE_ENV="production"

# Set port (already configured in .ebextensions)
eb setenv PORT="8080"
```

**Verify variables are set:**
```powershell
eb printenv
```

---

### üåê Step 3: Configure MongoDB Atlas Network Access

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas Console](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Navigate to: **Network Access**
3. Click: **"Add IP Address"**
4. **Option A (Recommended for production):**
   - Get your EB instance IP:
     ```powershell
     eb ssh
     curl ifconfig.me
     exit
     ```
   - Add that specific IP to MongoDB Atlas

5. **Option B (Quick for development):**
   - Add IP: `0.0.0.0/0` (Allows all IPs - **NOT recommended for production**)

6. Click: **"Confirm"**

---

### üß™ Step 4: Test Your Deployment

```powershell
# Open application in browser
eb open
```

Expected result: Browser opens showing:
```json
{"message": "Welcome to Wealth Management API"}
```

**Test API endpoints:**
```powershell
# Get your application URL
eb status

# Test health endpoint
curl http://your-eb-url.elasticbeanstalk.com/

# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://your-eb-url.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/users/register `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

---

### üìä Step 5: Monitor Application

```powershell
# View application logs
eb logs

# View real-time logs
eb logs --stream

# Check environment health
eb health

# View recent events
eb events
```

---

## üìÅ Important Files Created

1. **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive deployment documentation
2. **`ENV_SETUP_COMMANDS.txt`** - Quick reference for environment setup
3. **`.ebextensions/`** - EB configuration files
4. **`.ebignore`** - Files to exclude from deployment
5. **`.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml`** - EB project configuration

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Commands

### If Environment Creation Fails:
```powershell
# Check events for errors
eb events

# View detailed logs
eb logs

# Check current status
eb status

# If needed, terminate and recreate
eb terminate wealth-management-env
eb create wealth-management-env --instance-type t2.micro
```

### If Application Doesn't Start:
```powershell
# Check logs for startup errors
eb logs

# Verify environment variables
eb printenv

# Restart application
eb restart
```

### If MongoDB Connection Fails:
1. Verify `MONGODB_URI` is set correctly: `eb printenv`
2. Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
3. Test connection string locally first
4. Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
